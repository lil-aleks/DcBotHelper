# DcBotHelper
This will help you to build your own Discord bot faster!
## Implement to your project
``TODO``
## Get started
When creating a bot at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers), please donÂ´t forget to toggle every privileged gateway intent on.

### Starting the bot
#### Prepared method
You can start your bot using this method:
```java 
Bot.startBot(YOUR_TOKEN_HERE); // Enter your token
```
#### Custom method
Or create your own method and add the EventHandler to the EventLiteners.
```java
JDA bot = JDABuilder.createDefault(YOUR_TOKEN_HERE) // Enter your token
    .setStatus(OnlineStatus.ONLINE) // optional
    .setActivity(Activity.playing("nothing")) //optional
    .setChunkingFilter(ChunkingFilter.ALL)
    .setMemberCachePolicy(MemberCachePolicy.ALL)
    .enableIntents(
        GatewayIntent.GUILD_MEMBERS,
        GatewayIntent.GUILD_PRESENCES,
        GatewayIntent.GUILD_VOICE_STATES,
        GatewayIntent.DIRECT_MESSAGE_TYPING,
        GatewayIntent.DIRECT_MESSAGES,
        GatewayIntent.MESSAGE_CONTENT,
        GatewayIntent.GUILD_INVITES
    )
    .addEventListeners(
        new EventHandler() // DON'T FORGET THIS LINE
    )
    .build().awaitReady();
```
### Events
Here are some examples how to make some Events.
#### Slash-Command interactions:
Add `@OnCommand` with a `name` and `description` to a `public static` method and add `SlashCommandInteractionEvent event` as the parameter:
```java
// /ping command which response with "Pong"!
@OnCommand(name = "ping", description = "ping the bot")
public static void example(SlashCommandInteractionEvent event)
{
    event.reply("Pong!").setEphemeral(true).queue();
}
```
You can also add options to the command by adding as many `@CmdOption` to `options` as you want:
```java
// /time command which response with the time a Member is joined the server!
@OnCommand(name = "time", description = "when did a user  join!", options = {
        @CmdOption(name = "user", description = "who?", type = OptionType.USER, required = true)
})
public static void slashCmd(SlashCommandInteractionEvent event)
{
    Member member = event.getOption("user").getAsMember();
    event.reply(member.getAsMention() + " joined on " + member.getTimeJoined()).setEphemeral(true).queue();
}
```
Those methods will automatically create a slash command and execute whenever the command is used.
#### Button interactions:
Add `@OnButton` with a `id`  to a `public static` method and add `ButtonInteractionEvent event` as the parameter:
```java
// whenever a member presses a button with the id "verify"
// the member will get a specific role on the server.
@OnButton(id = "verify")
public static void verifyMember(ButtonInteractionEvent event)
{
    Member member = event.getMember();
    Role verifyRole = event.getGuild().getRoleById("1234567891234567891");
    event.getGuild().addRoleToMember(member, verifyRole).queue();
    event.reply("You are now verified!").setEphemeral(true).queue();
}
```
This method will execute whenever a button with that id is pressed.
#### Message receive
Add `@OnMessageReceived` on a `public static` method and add `MessageReceivedEvent event` as the parameter:
```java
// react with a :speech_balloon: when a messsage is received.
// I really couldn't think of any other example.
@OnMessageReceived()
public static void reactToAnyMessage(MessageReceivedEvent event)
{
    event.getMessage().addReaction(Emoji.fromFormatted(":speech_balloon:")).queue();
}
```
You can also make a method react to a specific message by adding `message`(Case is ignored in the string):
```java
// response whenever someone sends "Hello". (Case is ignored in the string)
@OnMessageReceived(message = "hello")
public static void responseOnHello(MessageReceivedEvent event)
{
    event.getMessage().reply("Hello " + event.getMember().getAsMention()).queue();
}
```
This methods will execute every time someone sends a message.
